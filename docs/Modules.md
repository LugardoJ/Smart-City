# üì¶ App Modules Overview ‚Äì Smart City

This document provides an overview of the modular structure of the Smart City application. Each module is designed to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), with a clear boundary between responsibilities.

---

## üß± Modular Design Philosophy

Each module contains:

- Independent `ViewModel` with injected `UseCases`
- Views (`SwiftUI`) that bind to `@Observable` ViewModels
- `UseCases` orchestrating domain logic
- Protocol-based `Repositories` for abstraction
- Optional `DataSources` (local, remote, in-memory)

## üì¶ Module Breakdown

### üîç Search Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `CitySearchView` | Displays a filtered list of cities (all or favorites), shows which are marked as favorites. |
| `CitySearchViewModel` | Handles query debounce, slicing, favorite sync, and metrics logging. |
| `SearchCitiesUseCase` | Core use case for filtered prefix search. |
| `RecordSearchTermUseCase` | Logs user input. |
| `RecordSearchLatencyUseCase` | Measures search performance. |
| `CityRepository` | Abstracted access to in-memory dataset. |

---

### üìå Detail Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `CityDetailView` | Displays the selected city with a map. Hosts the info button that presents `CityInfoCard`. |
| `CityDetailViewModel` | Manages favorite state, city summary, and view metrics. Injected into `CityInfoCard`. |
| `CityInfoCard` | Slide-up UI for detailed city info and favorite toggle. Receives `CityDetailViewModel` as input. |
| `WikipediaCitySummaryRepository` | Loads summary from Wikipedia API. |
| `RecordCityVisitUseCase` | Logs city views. |
| `ToggleFavoriteCityUseCase` | Marks or unmarks city as favorite. |
| `FavoriteCityRepository` | Manages persistence via SwiftData. |

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `FavoriteCityRepository` | CRUD for SwiftData-backed favorite cities |
| `mergeFavorites` | Injects persisted state into in-memory dataset |
| `ToggleFavoriteCityUseCase` | Shared use case across views |
| `CityEntity`, `FavoriteCityEntity` | Data persistence layer |

---

### üìä Metrics Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `MetricsDashboardView` | Displays metrics UI: top cities, terms, latency |
| `MetricsDashboardViewModel` | Fetches aggregated metrics and formats for display |
| `MetricsRecording` / `MetricsQuerying` | Dual protocols for write/read tracking |
| `AmplitudeMetricsAdapter` | Decorator for sending data to Amplitude and SwiftData |
| `FetchTopVisitedCitiesUseCase` | Queries top N visited cities |
| `FetchTopSearchedTermsUseCase` | Queries top N search terms |

---

### üìà Recent Searches Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `SearchHistoryEntity` | Stores recent terms in SwiftData |
| `FetchRecentSearchesUseCase` | Loads suggestions from history |
| `RecordSearchTermUseCase` | Also logs to recent queries |

---

### üß≠ Coordinator Module

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `AppCoordinator` | Controls flow and navigation |
| `NavigationPath`, `NavigationStack`, `NavigationSplitView` | Device-based navigation structure |
| `Route enum` | Declarative route modeling |
| `CompactLandscapeView` | Custom split layout for iPhone in landscape mode |

---

## üß™ Testing & Fixtures

- `InMemoryCityRepository` is used both in production and testing:
  - At runtime, it serves as the in-memory cache for cities loaded from SwiftData
  - It avoids expensive SwiftData queries by holding indexed and sorted results
  - In tests, it enables fully mockable and deterministic environments
- `cities.json` is loaded from `Fixtures/` for offline test scenarios
- UseCases and ViewModels are decoupled via protocols, making them easy to mock

## ‚úÖ Summary

This modular setup ensures separation of concerns, reuse of core logic, and consistent architectural patterns across the app.
